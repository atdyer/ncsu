                <h1>Coordinate Transformations in ADCIRC.io</h1>

                <p>
                    There seems to be a lot of confusion over how coordinate systems are used in ADCIRC.io, so I'm
                    hoping to clear things up here.
                    I think the easiest way to get a full understanding of how selections work in ADCIRC.io is going
                    to be a step-by-step walkthrough, from reading the data to displaying the mesh to performing a
                    selection. That way I can explain the bits and pieces of various code/libraries/3D concepts that are
                    really necessary, as opposed to trying to learn Javascript/three.js/3D coordinate transformations
                    all separately and then bringing them together.
                    First I'll talk about how the data is read from the fort.14 file and transformed into a coordinate
                    system that can be displayed. Then I'll show how the data is used in three.js to provide
                    interactivity, and finally, I'll show how to get the coordinates (in the mesh's local coordinate
                    system) of a click on screen.
                </p>

                <h2>Preparing an ADCIRC Mesh for Display</h2>

                <p>
                    First we'll look at how an ADCIRC mesh is displayed using three.js. As an example, we'll take a look
                    at the following subdomain:
                </p>

                <img src="img/subdomain.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"><br>

                <p>
                    First, let's look at the bounding box of the mesh straight out of the fort.14 file:

                </div>

                <p>
                    A few things to note:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The x- and y- coordinates fall in a very small range, while the z-values fall into a wider
                        range. This is because the x- and y- coordinates are in degrees longitude/latitude
                        while the z-coordinates are in meters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The x- and y- coordinates are not centered on zero. Again, they are in degrees longitude/latitude,
                        so they are centered somewhere around (-78, 34).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    So, in order to render the mesh on screen, we want to do two things. First, we want to center the
                    mesh around the coordinates (0, 0) so that it is centered on the screen. Second, we want to
                    scale the x- and y- coordinates so that they are on the same scale as the z-coordinates. Without
                    doing this scaling, when viewing the mesh from the side, it appears to be covered in
                    extremely tall, narrow mountains, as shown in the following image:
                </p>

                <img src="img/no-scale.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"><br>

                <p>
                    The code that calculates the translation and scaling needed to properly display the mesh is found in
                    the <code>/js/files/Fort14.js</code> file. The following code snippet from that file shows the
                    <code>finish_loading()</code> function, which is called once the fort.14 file has been read
                    and the mesh data has been stored in a three.js mesh object.

                    The important bits:

                        <strong>Line 230</strong> - Calculate the bounding box of the mesh. This gives us the
                        min and max coordinates that we looked at above. A THREE.Box3 object is a
                        simple object in the three.js library that provides functionality for things like calculating
                        the bounding box of different types of three-dimensional objects.

                        The <code>boundingBox.center()</code> function returns the x-, y-, and z- coordinates of the

                        function simply negates each one of the values. In line 236, we set the z-offset to zero because
                        we only want to move the mesh in the horizontal plane. The values of the offset vector for the
                        example mesh are:<br><br>

                        stored in a <code>4xn</code> matrix, where <code>n</code> is the total number of nodes. A
                        4x4 rotation matrix can be used to apply rotations and translations more easily than using
                        for loops. So, we put our translation values into a 4x4 matrix using the <code>setPosition()</code>
                        function that is part of a <code>THREE.Matrix4</code> object.

                        comment in the code, it is a little misworded. Because the values in the horizontal direction
                        are in degrees lat/lon, we want to uniformly scale them up so that they are comparable to the
                        scale of the z- values. We calculate this value as ten times the z-range divided by
                        the smaller of the x- and y- ranges. This calculation is fairly arbitrary, I've just found that
                        it is pretty good at giving a mesh that is pleasing to look at. The horizonal scaling factor
                        for the example mesh comes out to be <code>1211.2570614530628</code>

                <h2>Displaying an ADCIRC Mesh</h2>

                <p>
                    Now that the mesh is scaled and translated, rendering of the mesh can be handled by three.js. Two
                    tutorials that you really should read are
                    <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene">Creating a Scene in three.js</a>
                    and
                    <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Introduction/Matrix_transformations">Matrix Transformations in three.js</a>.
                    The most important things to get out of those are that you render things by adding them to a scene,
                    and that every instance of an <code>Object3d</code> has a matrix which stores that object's position
                    relative to it's parent. It is also very important to know that the scenes that you add objects
                    to are also <code>Object3d</code> instances, and therefore have their own matrices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, knowing this, take a look at the <code>/js/Managers/MeshManager.js</code> file. It is reponsible
                    for creating Fort14 objects and adding them to the scene. Specifically, the following lines:

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Let's take a closer look at <code>OrbitScene</code> and how it is set up to render a mesh.
                </p>

                <h3>OrbitScene</h3>

                <p>
                    The <code>OrbitScene</code> object is reponsible for rendering the ADCIRC mesh and providing
                    interactivity. It allows the user to pan, rotate, and zoom around the mesh. Take a look at the
                    following code in <code>/js/scenes/OrbitScene.js</code>:
                </p>

                <pre class="prettyprint linenums:28">//// Create the camera
this.width = canvas.width();
this.height = canvas.height();
this.camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(
    -canvas.width() / 2,
    canvas.width() / 2,
    canvas.height() / 2,
    -canvas.height() / 2,
    -1000000,
    1000000
);

// Position the camera
this.camera.position.z = 1;
this.camera.up.set( 0, 0, 1 );


//// Create the scene Graph
this.tiltScene = new THREE.Scene();
this.rotateScene = new THREE.Scene();
this.panScene = new THREE.Scene();

this.rotateScene.add( this.panScene );
this.tiltScene.add( this.rotateScene );</pre><br>

                <p>
                    There are a few things happening here. First, in lines 28 through 38, we're creating an orthographic
                    camera. The camera is what is responsible for displaying a three dimensional scene on a two
                    dimensional screen. Basically, you define a rectangle on the screen and that box is projected into
                    your three dimensional scene. Any object that falls inside of the bounds of the projected rectangle
                    is then drawn on the rectangle, as seen in this picture:
                </p>

                <img src="img/orthographic.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block"><br>

                <p>
                    The values we pass into the orthographic camera object in lines 32 through 35 are defining the
                    rectangle bounds. If the rendering cavas has dimensions of 800x600 pixels, any object in your
                    three dimensional scene that falls in the bounds of (-400, -300) to (400, 300) will show up on the
                    screen. The two values on lines 36 and 37 define how far into the screen to look for objects to
                    render, and passing in the very large values essentially tells it to look infinitely far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that the values passed into the camera do not necessarily need to correspond to the canvas
                    dimensions. We could have told the camera to look in the bounds (-1, -1) to (1, 1). However, doing
                    so would stretch the image horizontally since the camera would be mapping a square view of the
                    three dimensional scene onto a rectangular canvas. Using the canvas dimensions to define the camera
                    dimensions simplifies maintaining an aspect ratio that does not distort the image.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, take a look at lines 46 through 51. This is where we create what is called a scene graph. In
                    the case of ADCIRC.io, the scene graph is used to create the special type of interactivity we want
                    in order to easily interact with ADCIRC meshes. Recall that each <code>THREE.Scene</code> object
                    is essentially it's own coordinate system (defined by a rotation matrix), and that these scenes
                    are instances of <code>THREE.Object3d</code>. Because of this, we can
                    add scenes to other scenes, and when we manipulate a 'parent' scene, the effects will propagate
                    down to it's 'children' scenes. Additionally, manipulating a 'child' scene will have no effect
                    on the 'parent' scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So in lines 46 through 48, we've created a <code>tiltScene</code>, which is a scene that we'll only
                    ever tilt (by rotating all objects it contains about it's own local x-axis), a
                    <code>rotateScene</code>, which is a scene we'll only ever rotate (by rotating all objects it
                    contains about it's own local z-axis), and a <code>panScene</code>, which is a scene that we'll only
                    ever pan (by moving all objects it contains on it's own x-y plane).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, in lines 50 and 51, we create the scene graph by adding the <code>panScene</code> to the
                    <code>rotateScene</code>, and the <code>rotateScene</code> to the <code>tiltScene</code>. The
                    following demo shows how these nested scenes interact:
                </p>

                <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                <canvas id="glcanvas" class="col-md-12">
                    Your browser doesn't appear to support the HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.
                </canvas>
                </div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <p>
                    Use the left mouse button to rotate/tilt, and the right mouse button to pan. The scroll wheel can
                    be used to zoom in and out. The red box represents the <code>tiltScene</code>, the green box
                    represents the <code>rotateScene</code>, and the blue box represents the <code>panScene</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that when you tilt by left-clicking and dragging up and down, all three boxes are
                    tilted. This is because the tilt is being applied to the <code>tiltScene</code>, which contains the
                    other two scenes, and so tilting it causes everything it contains to be tilted by the same amount.
                    On the other hand, when you drag by right-clicking and dragging, only the blue box moves. This is
                    because the panning operation is only applied to the <code>panScene</code>, which is contained
                    inside of the other two scenes. The blue cube only ever pans in that scene's local x-y plane.
                    As you can see, however, the orientation of that x-y plane is determined by the orientation of it's
                    parents in the scene graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In ADCIRC.io, once the mesh is created, it is added to the <code>panScene</code> so that it can
                    be rendered. It will behave the same way the blue box behaves in the example above.
                </p>

                <h2>Making Selections</h2>

                <p>
                    Alright, now that we've got the mesh translated, scaled, and placed into the scene graph for
                    rendering, how can we get the coordinates (in the fort.14 file's coordinate system) of a clicked
                    point? Put simply, when the user clicks on the screen, we want to reverse all of the rotations and
                    translations that have happened to get the mesh rendered on the screen.
                </p>

                <h3>Screen to Local Coordinates</h3>

                <p>
                    First, we're going to need to get the coordinates of the click in the local coordinate system of
                    the <code>panScene</code>, since it is the scene that the mesh is added to. The following function
                    can do just that:
                </p>

                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">function screen_to_local( orbit_scene, x, y ) {

    // Get the screen coordinates normalized
    var vector = new THREE.Vector3(
        ( x / orbit_scene.width ) * 2 - 1,
        -( y / orbit_scene.height ) * 2 + 1,
        0.0
    );

    // Convert normalized screen coordinates to world coordinates
    // and project onto the z=0 plane of the tiltScene
    vector.unproject( orbit_scene.camera ).setZ( 0 );
    vector.setY( vector.y / Math.sin( Math.PI/2 - orbit_scene.tiltScene.getWorldRotation().x ) );

    // Get the point on the z=0 plane in global coordinates
    orbit_scene.tiltScene.localToWorld( vector );

    // Get the global coordinates in local mesh coordinates
    orbit_scene.panScene.worldToLocal( vector );

    return vector;

}</pre><br>

                <p>
                    There is actually a lot going on here, so let's take it line by line.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Line 1</strong> - This function takes three inputs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <code>ADCIRC.OrbitScene</code> object that contains the mesh</li>
                            <li>The x-coordinate of the click on the 2D canvas</li>
                            <li>The y-coordinate of the click on the 2D canvas</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lines 4 through 8</strong> - Convert the screen coordinates into normalized coordinates.
                        Normalized coordinates are needed for the next step, and they essentially indicate the distance
                        from the origin as a percentage of the maximum displayed distance from the origin.
                        So if the origin is at the center of the
                        viewport, the bottom left of the viewport will be at the coordinates (-1, -1), corresponding
                        to -100% to the left of the origin, and 100% below the origin. The same goes for the top right
                        of the viewport -- it is located at (1, 1) corresponding to 100% to the right of the origin,
                        and 100% above the origin. If you add the line <code>console.log( vector.x, vector.y )</code>
                        immediately after line 8, you will see these values printed (call this function on the mouse
                        move event to see these values in real-time).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Line 12</strong> - Unproject the normalized vector. This is a helper function provided
                        by the three.js library. Passing the camera object to the unproject function of a normalized
                        vector will convert the coordinates to a location in the camera's viewport. Recall that earlier
                        we said a viewport that is 800x600 pixels will set the camera bounds to be (-400,-300) to
                        (400, 300). In that case, if we've got a normalized vector with values (-1, -1), which
                        corresponds to the bottom left of the viewport, calling unproject with that camera will give
                        us the coordinates (-400, -300), which corresponds to the bottom left of the camera's viewport.
                        Again, call <code>console.log( vector.x, vector.y )</code> immediately after line 12 to see
                        these values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Line 13</strong> - Get the coordinates on the z = 0 plane of the <code>tiltScene</code>.
                        In the previous step, we got the x- and y- coordinates of the mouse click in what is essentially
                        the global coordinate system. However, because we are able to tilt, rotate, and translate our
                        scene, these coordinates will become invalid as soon as we perform one of those operations.
                        The three.js library provides convenient functions called <code>scene.localToWorld</code> and
                        <code>scene.worldToLocal</code> that make coordinate transformations very simple, but first we
                        must project our global coordinates onto the <code>tiltScene</code> plane of z=0. Consider the
                        following image, in which the scene has not been tilted. The point on the screen will correctly
                        correspond to the point on the scene:
                        <img src="img/no-rotate.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block">
                        However, in the next image, the scene has been tilted. If we don't do a projection, when the
                        user clicks in one spot on the screen, the returned point will fall below where the click
                        actually occurred, as shown:
                        <img src="img/rotate.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block">
                        Therefore, we need to project the clicked point onto the tilted scene in order to get a point
                        in the tilted scene's local coordinate system, as shown here:
                        <img src="img/project.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block">
                        This is simple geometry, as shown:
                        <img src="img/trig.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block">
                        This equation is what we use in line 13 to get the correct y-coordinate in the
                        <code>tiltScene</code>. It is equal to the current y-coordinate divided by the sine of the
                        rotation about the <code>tiltScene</code>'s x-axis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Line 16</strong> - Now that we have the coordinates in the coordinate system of one
                        of the scenes in the scene graph, we can use the three.js helper functions to do coordinate
                        transformations. This line takes us from the <code>tiltScene</code> local coordinate system
                        to the global coordinate system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Line 19</strong> - This final line takes us from the global coordinate system down to
                        the <code>panScene</code> local coordinate system. Note that we can't just use the
                        <code>worldToLocal</code> function to go straight from <code>tiltScene</code> coordinates to
                        <code>panScene</code> coordinates, we must first go to global coordinates since the
                        <code>worldToLocal</code> function will step through each scene in the scene graph and perform
                        a coordinate transformation at each level until it reaches the desired local coordinate system.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Local to Mesh Coordinates</h3>

                <p>
                    Finally, we're at the last step. We've got the local coordinates of the click, but recall that when the
                    mesh was created, it was translated and then scaled. We need to reverse these operations to get the
                    coordinates of the click in the mesh's original coordinate system (as defined in the fort.14 file). Here
                    is a simple function that can perform this step:
                </p>

                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">function scale_and_translate ( mesh, vector ) {

    vector.divideScalar( mesh.fort14.horizontal_scale );
    vector.applyMatrix4( ( new THREE.Matrix4() ).getInverse( mesh.fort14.offset ) );

}</pre><br>

                <p>
                    First, we divide by the scale (since we multiplied by the scale when we created the mesh) in line 3,
                    and then we translate by the inverse of the offset matrix that was used to perform the initial
                    translation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With that, you'll now have the coordinates of the mesh that fall directly underneath the mouse click
                    regardless of the orientation of the mesh on the screen.
