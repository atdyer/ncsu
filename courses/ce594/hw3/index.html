        <h1>Problem #1</h1>
        <h2>
            Write a 1D finite element code to solve the following linear heat conduction problem:
            <ul>
                <li>Area = 0.1 m<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>k = 0.5 W/m&deg;C</li>
                <li>Length = 1m</li>
                <li>u(0) = u(1) = 0</li>
                <li>s = 5 W/m</li>
            </ul>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The code used for all problems in this assignment is provided in the following two files:
            <div class="selector"><a href="fe.html">Finite Element Code</a></div>
            <div class="selector"><a href="shape_functions.html">Shape Function Code</a></div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The finite element code is capable of solving the 1D linear heat conduction problem for any set of valid
            boundary conditions, a source term, and with any number of element nodes. The boundary values are provided
            as Python dictionaries, one each for the essential and natural boundary conditions. The source term must
            be provided as a callable function (or lambda function) that returns the source value given an x-location.
            Additional parameters are required, as outlined by the documentation in the comments at the start of the
            <code>solve_fe</code> function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take note that the number of element nodes is provided as an option in the <code>solve_fe</code> function.
            The finite element code will generate all of the shape functions and derivatives using the
            <code>shape_functions</code> function. This function returns the three following lists:
            <ul>
                <li>N - List of shape functions, one for each element node</li>
                <li>dN - The first derivative of each shape function in the list N</li>
                <li>xi - The coordinates of each node in the element, on the domain [-1,1]</li>
            </ul>
            Each shape function and derivative that is generated is a Python lambda function and is callable with a
            value of <code>xi</code> (i.e. any value between -1 and 1).
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution to Problem #1 is plotted below. Only 2-node linear elements are used in this problem, and the
            finite element solution is plotted alongside the exact solution. Use the number picker below the chart
            to plot the solution for a different number of elements (up to 8 are provided).

            <h2>
                For this part you will extend your 1D finite element code from Problem #1 to solve the following linear
                heat conduction problem (the boundary conditions and source term have changed):
                <ul>
                    <li>Area = 0.1m<sup>2</sup></li>
                    <li>k = 0.5 W/m&deg;C</li>
                    <li>Length = 1m</li>
                    <li>u(0) = 10&deg;C</li>
                    <li>h = 25 W/m<sup>2</sup> at x = 1</li>
                    <li>s(x) = 5x W/m<sup>2</sup></li>
                </ul>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The code used for this problem is identical to the code used in Problem #1. The only change required is
                to provide the correct boundary conditions and source terms. Additionally, parts A and B of this problem
                are solved using different numbers of element nodes, which is also an input option in my finite element
                code.

                The following two plots show the errors calculated in parts A and B (along with and additional solution
                calculated using 4-node elements). The first plot shows the displacement error in the L2 norm and the
                second shows the error in the energy norm. Note that for each plot, the x-axis is reversed, with element
                size decreasing to the right.
