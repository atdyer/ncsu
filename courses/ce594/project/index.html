    <h1>CE 594 - Final Project</h1>
    <p>
        For this project, we are going to analyze a seepage problem. Imagine there is a sand filled pipe buried
        underground below the water table and oriented from left to right. The pipe has a cross-sectional area of
        2m<sup>2</sup> and is 10m long. Water is flowing into the left end of the pipe at a rate of 100m<sup>3</sup>/day. At the right
        end of the pipe we measure the hydraulic head, <i class="ie">h</i>, (look it up on wiki if you need to) to be 3m. The wall
        of the pipe is made of a permeable material so that water can pass through, which effectively creates a
        source or sink depending on the hydraulic head inside the pipe. We will represent this as a source term
        of the form <i class="ie">\alpha_0 h</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The governing differential equation can be derived from Darcyâ€™s Law, which relates the volume rate of
        flow per unit area to the rate of change of the hydraulic head, given by
        <div id="e1"></div>
        where <i class="ie">k</i> is the hydraulic conductivity. For a steady state flow and assuming that water is incompressible,
        conservation of mass tells us that the amount of water flowing into any part of the pipe must be equal to
        the amount of water flowing out. In other words, any change in the volume rate of flow must balance
        any water gained or lost through a source or sink, respectively. Mathematically, this is stated as
        <div id="e2"></div>
        where <i class="ie">s</i> is the source term. For this problem we can replace <i class="ie">s</i> with
        <i class="ie">\alpha_0 h</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the following parameters
        <ol>
            <li>State the governing strong form problem, identifying essential and natural boundary conditions</li>
            <li>Derive the weak form</li>
            <li>Define appropriate approximation spaces and the Galerkin problem</li>
            <li>Develop the matrix equations showing how all coefficients are calculated</li>
            <li>Modify your finite element code to solve this problem using at least 8 elements</li>
            <li>Plot your solution and state the hydraulic head at the left end of the pipe and the amount of
            water flowing out of the right end</li>
        </ol>
        <div id="e3"></div>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>The complete hand-written solution can be found in the following pdf document:</p>
    <div class=selector><a href="project.pdf">Solution</a></div>
    <p>
    The hand-written solution contains the complete derivation of the matrix form starting from the
    strong form. Below, the strong form, weak form, Galerkin form, and matrix form are shown for
    reference.

    <h1>Code and Implementation</h1>
    <p>
        The code used to solve the matrix form of the equation is written in Python and composed
        of 3 scripts. A fourth script, containing the problem definition is used to execute the
        code and plot the results.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="project.html">project.py</a> - This script contains the problem definition. Run this script to
        solve the problem and generate a plot.</li>
        <li><a href="fe.html">fe.py</a> - This is the finite element implementation used to solve this problem. It
        builds the matrices defined in the above matrix form of the governing equation and solves for the profile
        of the hydraulic head along the length of the pipe.</li>
        <li><a href="jacobian.html">jacobian.py</a> - This script contains functions used in coordinate transformations.</li>
        <li><a href="shape_functions.html">shape_functions.py</a> - This script contains a function that can be used
        to generate shape functions and their derivatives for any number of element nodes. Further implementation
        details can be found on the page.</li>
    </ul>
