    <h1>CE 594 - Final Project</h1>
    <p>
        For this project, we are going to analyze a seepage problem. Imagine there is a sand filled pipe buried
        underground below the water table and oriented from left to right. The pipe has a cross-sectional area of
        2m<sup>2</sup> and is 10m long. Water is flowing into the left end of the pipe at a rate of 100m<sup>3</sup>/day. At the right
        end of the pipe we measure the hydraulic head, <i class="ie">h</i>, (look it up on wiki if you need to) to be 3m. The wall
        of the pipe is made of a permeable material so that water can pass through, which effectively creates a
        source or sink depending on the hydraulic head inside the pipe. We will represent this as a source term
        of the form <i class="ie">\alpha_0 h</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The governing differential equation can be derived from Darcyâ€™s Law, which relates the volume rate of
        flow per unit area to the rate of change of the hydraulic head, given by
        <div id="e1"></div>
        where <i class="ie">k</i> is the hydraulic conductivity. For a steady state flow and assuming that water is incompressible,
        conservation of mass tells us that the amount of water flowing into any part of the pipe must be equal to
        the amount of water flowing out. In other words, any change in the volume rate of flow must balance
        any water gained or lost through a source or sink, respectively. Mathematically, this is stated as
        <div id="e2"></div>
        where <i class="ie">s</i> is the source term. For this problem we can replace <i class="ie">s</i> with
        <i class="ie">\alpha_0 h</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the following parameters
        <ol>
            <li>State the governing strong form problem, identifying essential and natural boundary conditions</li>
            <li>Derive the weak form</li>
            <li>Define appropriate approximation spaces and the Galerkin problem</li>
            <li>Develop the matrix equations showing how all coefficients are calculated</li>
            <li>Modify your finite element code to solve this problem using at least 8 elements</li>
            <li>Plot your solution and state the hydraulic head at the left end of the pipe and the amount of
            water flowing out of the right end</li>
        </ol>
