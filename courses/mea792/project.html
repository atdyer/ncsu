                <p>
                    In this project, we introduce a method for training the classification of LIDAR point clouds using
                    classified raster datasets. Specifically, we will be exploring the effectiveness of these methods
                    on high density LIDAR point clouds collected from the Field Research Facility in Duck, NC. These
                    datasets are collected using a stationary LIDAR sensor mounted to the end of a crane-like tower,
                    placing the sensor approximately 20 feet above the dune. The sensor is part of an automated
                    workflow which collects data every hour in order to monitor both wave activity and the evolution
                    beach geomorphology. As part of the processing workflow, a point classification must occur so that
                    a bare earth DEM can be generated, and because of the frequency of collections, the algorithms
                    that perform the classification must be highly peformant. Additionally, because the data are only
                    being used to generate bare earth DEMs, the algorithms only need to be able to distinguish ground
                    from non-ground points.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In developing these algorithms, we have discovered that while they perform very well as far as
                    speed is concerned, a portion of the data is frequently mis-classified. By improving the accuracy
                    of the classification algorithms, not only will the resulting bare earth DEMs also be more accurate,
                    but we will be able to increase their resolution (lower resolution helps reduce the effect of
                    mis-classified points). Higher resolutions DEMs should provide a more robust dataset, allowing
                    scientists to see a wider range of morphological processes. The method introduced in this project
                    could be used in this workflow to improve the accuracy of the classification algorithms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The basic concept of this method is to use a previous classification to influence the parameters
                    that will be used in the classification of the current dataset. The previous classification will
                    be in a raster format, which can come from any number of data sources. As part of the workflow,
                    the classification of each raster cell associated with the previous hour could be used to guide
                    the classification of the point cloud of the current hour. The hope is that because the
                    collection is happening on such a fine time scale compared to the time scale on which the observed
                    processes are occuring, there will be fairly little change between consecutive classifications.
                </p>

                <!-- METHODS -->
                <a class="anchor" id="methods"></a>
                <h1 class="page-header">Methods</h1>

                <p>
                    In order to test the effectiveness of using classified raster datasets to train the classification
                    algorithm, I translated the classification algorithm into Python in order to simplify the
                    merging of the two datasets. Using Python allows for much faster prototyping, and the significant
                    leg work that is already performed by libraries such as GDAL and NumPy allow for decent performance.
                    First we'll discuss how the algorithm performs a classification (or rather, distinguishes
                    between ground and non-ground points).
                </p>

                <h2>The Classification Algorithm</h2>

                <p>
                    LIDAR sensors operate by emitting a pulse of light and measuring the amount of time it takes for
                    any reflected light to return to the sensor. Because the speed of light is known, the distance
                    between the reflecting object and the scanner can be calculated with a high level of accuracy.
                    Inside of the scanner, the initial pulse of light is bounced off of mirror that is attached to a
                    high precision motor. By rotating the mirror slightly inbetween measurements, a two-dimensional
                    dataset called a line scan can be acquired. Additionally, rotating the entire scanner enclosure
                    about the perpendicular axis inbetween line scans, a three-dimensional dataset called a frame scan
                    can be acquired.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The classification algorithms used in the data workflow at the FRF rely on high density line scans.
                    An assumption is made that within a single line scan, the higher the point density, the less
                    variability there should be in the vertical difference between consecutive ground points. This is
                    a valid assumption, especially at the scale at which the data is collected at the FRF (mm to cm
                    scale). The algorithm performs the following steps in order to distinguish ground points from
                    non-ground points (this process is performed on each individual line scan):
                </p>

                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <h4><strong>Keep a running count for each point in the linescan</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            As we step through each point in the linescan, we will be performing what is essentially
                            a preliminary classification multiple times for each point. We need to count the number
                            of times each point is 'pre-classified' as ground.

                        <p>
                            We use a moving stencil to consider a subset of consecutive points in the linescan. The
                            following steps are executed in order to perform the 'pre-classification', and the stencil
                            is advanced by a single point (i.e. n-1 of the points currently in the stencil of size n
                            will remain in the stencil).

                                    The noise factor is a value between 0 and 1 which indicates the amount of
                                    variability in elevation amongst the points inside of the stencil.
