                <p>
                    In this assigment you need to justify the choice of the flight area and prove that the geographical
                    and legal conditions allow for a safe flight execution. You will present your idea to your
                    collegues, so try to find an interesting research problem. The presentation needs to be short
                    (2-3min, just couple slides) and doesnâ€™t need to include all the information from the assignment.

                    The goal of this flight, is to collect aerial imagery of the FRF in Duck, NC so that imagery
                    processing techniques can be compared with LIDAR measurement techniques in a coastal setting.
                    We hope to be able to determine if beach volume can be accurately calculated using the DSMs
                    generated using aerial imagery, thus providing a much more cost effective way of studying the
                    evolution of our beaches as compared to current LIDAR techniques.

                    The following images show the target area, projected flight plan, and take-off and landing
                    locations for the Trimble UX5 flight:

                <p>
                    The flight area is private government property, owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers (permission
                    granted through research funding). The only obstacles in the area are a small gazebo in a parking
                    lot off the side of the main road, the main FRF building as well as two garages, and low shrubs and
                    bushes. While the area does not currently have a COA, aeronautical charts show that the property is
                    not located in any restricted airspace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The FRF property is approximate 1km alongshore and 0.6km wide, giving an area of 0.6km2. However,
                    the most important imagery to obtain is the beach itself. Ideally, I'd like to plan a mission that
                    flies very low over the beach in order to obtain higher resolution imagery (on the order of
                    millimeters/pixel) in order to compare with the extremely high resolution LIDAR data we collect.

                        Take-off location is from the main entrance road to the FRF. It is long and straight, and the
                        direction chosen is typically into the wind, meaning easier takeoff.

                <p>
                    I was unable to find a high resolution DEM that covered the entire flight area, so I worked with
                    the NCSU Lake Wheeler area data to practice using GRASS GIS to ensure that take-off and landing had
                    sufficient area and that the flight altitude was high enough to complete the flight without hitting
                    obstacles. The following image shows elevation differences between the DEM and flight elevations
                    (black = low difference, white = high difference):
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, I will be coming back to this assignment with the DEM that I'll generate using the image
                    processing techniques in the next assignment, just as a proof of concept.
