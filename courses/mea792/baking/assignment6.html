                    In this assignment, we'll analyze the differences between the LIDAR and UAS derived digital elevation
                    models and digital surface models.

                <p>
                    In this section, we'll evaluate the various DSMs in order to determine which are suitable for fusion.
                    We'll compare differences at GCP locations, as well as identify potential systematic error and
                    identify distortions.

                <p>
                    From the previous assignment, we know that the <span class="inline-code">mid_pines_ground_elev</span>
                    raster has an average error of around 5cm when compared to the GCPs. Therefore, we'll use it as a
                    baseline to compare the UAS DSMs to in order to determine which UAS DSM we'd like to use in our
                    fusion. Compute these differences using <span class="inline-code">r.mapcalc</span>:

                <p>
                    Comparing the two difference rasters, we can see that both the Agisoft and Pix4D DSMs are fairly
                    accurate (as compared to the LIDAR DSM) on bare earth surfaces. The Agisoft DSM appears to be
                    systematically lower than the LIDAR DSM in a large portion of the southern fields, while the
                    Pix4D DSM appears to by systematically lower than the LIDAR DSM in a large portion of the northeast
                    corner of the raster. We can use the profile tool to further show this systematic error (i.e.
                    averaging the differences in a given area doesn't reduce the overall difference).
                </p>

                <p>
                    This plot clearly shows a divergence in differences between the two software packages along the road.
                    The Agisoft differences (in blue) tend to hang out around zero difference, not really showing a
                    systematic difference. Pix4D (in red) on the other hand, has a gradual increase in difference
                    along the profile line, indicating that the Pix4D raster is typically lower in elevation than the
                    LIDAR raster. Additionally, we see a sharp drop of about 15cm in both difference plots at about 230m in the
                    profile plot. Because it occurs in both plots, we can infer that the drop (assuming it does not
                    actually exist in the real world) is an artifact found in the LIDAR DSM. Going back to
                    <a href="assignment5.html">Assignment 5</a>, recall that there was a distinct line going through
                    the center of the flight-line overlap that we determined to be an artifact of the classification
                    algorithm.

                <p>
                    This plot clearly shows that the Pix4D (in red) DSM has very little difference from the LIDAR DSM
                    along the profile line in the southern fields. The Agisoft (in blue) DSM, however, is systematically
                    lower than the LIDAR DSM (because difference values are positive). Additionally, we can see a large
                    jump in negative differences in both rasters where the profile line crosses over an area of dense
                    vegetation. Because the imagery used to generate the UAS DSMs was taken (years) later than the
                    LIDAR data was collected, there are significant differences in vegetation height. This plot suggests
                    that there was much taller vegetation in that are when the UAS was flown as compared to when the
                    LIDAR data was collected.

                <a class="anchor" id="correcting"></a>
                <h1 class="page-header">Correcting LIDAR Shift</h1>

                <p>
                    As we have seen in the previous section, there are areas of systematic error between the LIDAR
                    derived and UAS derived DSMs. We have seen that this difference is very small, but if we wanted
                    to correct for this data, we could determine an overall systematic shift and subtract it from
                    either the LIDAR or UAS DSMs. Here, I'm going to correct the LIDAR DSM since it is used to calculate
                    differences in both of the UAS DSMs. Recall from <a href="assignment5.html">Assignment 5</a> that
                    we had a very small (on the order of a few centimeters) difference in elevation at the GCP locations.
                    Averaging the differences at each GCP location gives an average difference of 0.051m (5.1cm).
                    This is a good starting point when considering a shift value. We apply this shift and calculate
                    the new differences using <span class="inline-code">r.mapcalc</span>.
                </p>

                    As we can see, in both cases the differences appear to have shrunk. This can be confirmed by once
                    again viewing profiles along selected areas. The profiles in the following sections show the
                    original differences we calculated along with the new, corrected, differences we've calculated along
